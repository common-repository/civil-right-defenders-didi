DiDi is an easy-to-use tool designed to help human rights defenders to efficiently record, analyse and visualise data on human rights violations.

== Description ==

The Defenders’ Database (DiDi) is an easy-to-use tool designed to help human rights defenders to efficiently record, analyse and visualise data on human rights violations.

== Features ==

Recording: Human rights defenders can submit records of violations on DiDi both online and offline. There is an excel template that can be imported to the database. It is also possible to attach documents, photos and links to each report.

Filtering: The DiDi users can filter their reports in the database and export the data for the purpose of visualisation and analysis.

Parsing: Human rights organisations all over the world store and save records of human rights violations in different formats. Whether it is in PDF, Word, Excel or paperback, there is a lack of coherence in most suitable format. In order to achieve consistency, we have created a parsing module that can read old reports. Please contact us directly if you have a dataset you would like to import to DiDi.

== Visualising ==

If you become a certified user, you will be able to share the total number of violations added by your organisation through the map-and-graph-tool at the DiDi web page. The data can then be filtered according to the wishes of the visitor. The data is always anonymised.

== Plugin ==

The DiDi Wordpress plugin allows users to visualise aggregated datasets depending on need and preference. Through the Wordpress plugin you can show data from DiDi on your Wordpress based website to advocate for human rights in your country or region.

The visualisation offers many possibilities for customisation. The options offered makes it possible for human rights groups and defenders to publish data on issues they care for, in a way that makes other people care.”
